## A Companion to launch native dummy programs 
This was made to launch empty dummy programs that do absolutely nothing, for the sole purpose of having them be selectable when playing windows games using WINE or Java in Discord. For example, if you play Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines using wine, the .exe file is called `Vampire.exe`. Discord on Linux will not show that as a game. What this does is copy a dummy program written in C, renames it Vampire.exe.dummy and launches it while you play. After you are done playing it should automatically kill the dummy program and remove it from the temporary folder. This allows you to add a custom game called "Vampire.exe.dummy" to discord, and then rename it to "Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines", allowing you to show everyone that you have great taste in games.

## How to use 
**Step 1** download or git clone  

**Step 2a** You trust me: delete dummy.c if you want, it's not needed.  

**Step 2b** You don't trust me: check the script and the C source code for anythig üêü-y, delete the `dummy` binary and then compile the dummy file from scratch (that would be `gcc -o dummy dummy.c`).  

**Step 3** Run discordcomp.sh

You do not need to launch it with every game or something. It is essentially intended as background service. 

## Possible Bugs / Known issues
 - If you wanna stop the script, make sure any wine programs are closed before. Or just manually kill all the `name-of-exefile.exe.dummy` programs later. Not really a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it.


## To-do / Wishlist
 - Maybe I should look into how to write PKGBUILD files? That way I could write an AUR package. Technically I think something could be done with RPM too (maybe?), but that just looks confusing af, and I do not use it. As for .deb packages, I do not think that they can be used to install random files from github. AFAIK they always have to be buit in advance to contain a certain version of a file. Technically flatpak might also be an option.

<- the main reason I put this together, since discord *still* doesn't support wine applications and it's annoying to have to manually quit the dummy app.
